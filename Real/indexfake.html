        <h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
        <p>The Parallax Effect is a visual technique often used in web development to create depth and dynamism on websites. This technique simulates spatial movement by having different layers of content scroll at varying speeds. It gives the impression that the background is farther away than the foreground, resulting in an immersive user experience.</p>

            <div class="parallax-inner">
                <h1>Parallax Effect</h1>
            </div>
        </section>
        <p>The Parallax Effect works by using CSS and JavaScript to control the scroll speed of specific elements. For example, a background might scroll more slowly than text or images in the foreground. This technique is often combined with fixed background images that appear "anchored" in depth while other content flows above them.</p>
        <p>The style of the Parallax Effect is usually minimalistic yet impactful. High-resolution background images, ranging from stunning landscapes to abstract designs, play a central role. Combined with smooth transitions, subtle animations, and elegant typography, the Parallax Effect can significantly enhance the design of a website and guide the viewer's focus effectively.</p>
